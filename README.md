# Jaine

Jaine (pronounced like the name Jane) is a small game engine framework written in jai.
The name *Jaine* is an adaption of the name *jai* to make it sound more like the word *engine*: ~~en~~**jai**ne

She is currently a **work in progress** in its early stages. 
You may study her source but I do not recommend to use it as a tool in production. 
There simply is not enough functionality at the time.
A change in it's production ready status will be reflected in this readme.
