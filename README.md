# Jaine

Jaine (pronounced like the name Jane) is a small game engine library written in jai.
The name *Jaine* is an adaption of the name *jai* to make it sound more like the word *engine*: ~~en~~**jai**ne

## Philosophy

This library simplifies the creation of games and game engines.
The goal is to enable people to easily build their own engine for the specific needs of their own game.

The result will be faster and smaller games and engines with much less complexity and therefore fewer possible bugs.
Not to mention a potential spiking increase in developer happiness, satisfaction and available time.

## Work In Progress!

Jaine is currently a **work in progress** in her early stages. 
I do not recommend to employ her in production yet since a lot of functionality is still missing.

## Features

**All features are 2D only!**
We will keep it that way in order to benefit from simplicity.

### Camera
- Pan the camera

### Objects
- Create & delete objects

### Selection
- Select & unselect one object at the time
- Transform selection
-- Move selection along x, y or xy by using a gizmo
-- Rotate selection by using a gizmo

### Coordinate System
