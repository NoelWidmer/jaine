# Jaine

Jaine (pronounced like the name Jane) is a small game engine library written in jai.
The name *Jaine* is an adaption of the name *jai* to make it sound more like the word *engine*: ~~en~~**jai**ne

She is currently a **work in progress** in her early stages. 
You may study her source but I do not recommend to employ her in production. 
There simply is not enough functionality at the time.

## Features

**All features are 2D only!** We will keep it that way to benefit from simplicity.
If we want to support 3D we will create a separate library at a later date.

### Camera
- Pan the camera

### Objects
- Create & delete objects

### Selection
- Select & unselect one object at the time
- Transform selection
-- Move selection along x, y or xy by using a gizmo
-- Rotate selection by using a gizmo

### Coordinate System
